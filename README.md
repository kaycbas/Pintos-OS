# Pintos

## Welcome to Pintos
Pintos is an educational 80x86 operating system framework developed by Ben Pfaff. As mentioned in class, there will be four programming assignments this semester. All of the programming assignments in this class are centered around implementing the core functionality of the Pintos operating system. This repository contains the Pintos skeleton code and documentation, should you need to reference it throughout the semester.
