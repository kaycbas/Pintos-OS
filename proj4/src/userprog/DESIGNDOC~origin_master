Anthony Wittemann <awittema@usc.edu>
Kevin Bastoul <bastoul@usc.edu>

---- PRELIMINARIES ----

>> If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, notes for the
>> TAs, or extra credit, please give them here.

>> Please cite any offline or online sources you consulted while
>> preparing your submission, other than the Pintos documentation, course
>> text, lecture notes, and course staff.

			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In syscall.c:
#define BOTTOM_VADDR ((void *) 0x08048000) //used for validating pointers within a proper range

In process.c:
#define WORD_SIZE 4 //number of characters each word occupies
#define DEFAULT_NUM_ARGS 2 //default to have 2 arguments passed (a command and a parameter)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

There's a potential for race conditions in strtok() because if 2 threads are in the kernel, 
one thread could use the token of another thread since the point where the last token was found is kept internally by the function. 


>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

1) The shell allocates memory instead of the kernel. This is an advantage because if the kernel runs out of memory, the system crashes, but if the shell runs out of memory, only the shell crashes.

2) The shell does the input filtering to make sure the arguments are valid before passing control to the kernel.


			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
